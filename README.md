# EXE Setup
1) Follow the instructions [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#creating-a-bot-account) to create a bot and obtain a bot token (you don't need to worry about the bot name or avatar). **Save the bot token for later.**
2) Follow the instructions [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#inviting-your-bot) to invite the bot to a server of your choice. **The bot should have the `Send Messages`permission only.**
3) Download and run [`github_code_bot.exe`](https://github.com/SeanJxie/DiscordCodeBot/blob/main/github_code_bot.exe?raw=true). 
4) You will be prompted for your bot token once. Enter your token and your bot should be good to go!

# Python Windows Setup

```
Next, move into the repo:
```
cd GithubCodeBot
```
Then, install the required packages:
