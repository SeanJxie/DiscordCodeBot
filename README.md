# DiscordCodeBot
A discord bot that searches for valid Github code links and displays them with `urllib`, `bs4`, and the `discord` api.

![sample](https://github.com/SeanJxie/DiscordCodeBot/blob/main/sample.jpg)

Why didn't I use the Github API? I don't know. It's a good web-scraping exercise, though.

# Commands
Just one: `!longcode` toggles the bot's ability to display code over the 2000 character limit on Discord.

# Setup
Follow the instructions [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html) to obtain a bot token. Paste the token in the `bot_token` file. The instructions to invite the bot can also be found in the given link.
