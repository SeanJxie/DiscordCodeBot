# DiscordCodeBot
A discord bot that searches for valid Github code links and displays them with `urllib`, `bs4`, and the `discord` api.

Why didn't I use the Github API? I don't know. It's a good web-scraping exercise, though.

# Commands
Just one: `!longcode` toggles the bot's ability to display code over the 2000 character limit on Discord.
