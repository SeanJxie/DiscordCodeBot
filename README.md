# DiscordCodeBot

![example](https://github.com/SeanJxie/DiscordCodeBot/blob/main/exampleImage.png)

# Setup
- Follow the instructions [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#creating-a-bot-account) to create a bot and obtain a bot token (you don't need to worry about the bot name or avatar). Save the token for later.
- Follow the instructions [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#inviting-your-bot) to invite the bot to a server of your choice. The bot should have the `Send Messages`permission only.
- Download and run [`github_code_bot.exe`](https://github.com/SeanJxie/DiscordCodeBot/blob/main/github_code_bot.exe?raw=true). You will be prompted for your token.

# Commands
Just one: `!longcode` toggles the bot's ability to display code over the 2000 character limit on Discord.
